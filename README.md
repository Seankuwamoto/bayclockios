# Bayclock iOS app

An iOS adaptation of the [Bayclock website](https://www.bayclock.org/). 
It gives info about current class schedules and lunch menu items for students at The Bay School of San Francisco.

Github repo for bayclock website: [https://github.com/FairfieldBW/clock](https://github.com/FairfieldBW/clock)

## Features
- Date, time, and current class indicators
- Customizable daily schedule
- Progress bars
- Lunch menu

## Maintaining

Currently, all the data for classes, lunch menus, breaks, immersives, and special events are stored locally, but by 1.0 release, it should all be coming from the bayclock website. This means that if the app is out of date, it's because of the website is too.

## Downloading/Installing

Currently, the app is not avialable for public use. Beta testing with select few will probably begin soon and I aim to have the app released on the App Store by the end of the 2022 spring semester. This app is **not** planned to be on the android Play Store. It will be iOS exclusive.
